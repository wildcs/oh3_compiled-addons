# TapoControl Binding for openhab

This binding adds support to control Tapo (Copyright Â© TP-Link Corporation Limited) Smart Home Devices from your local openHAB system.
(Note: This is not an official Tapo/TP-link Binding!)

## Supported Things

The following Tapo-Devices are supported

### P100 SmartPlug (WiFi)

* Power On/Off
* Wi-Fi signal (SignalStrenght)
* On-Time (Time in seconds device is switched on)

## Prerequisites

Before using Smart Plugs with openHAB the devices must be connected to the Wi-Fi network.
This can be done using the Tapo provided mobile app.

## Discovery

Discovery is not supported at the moment. You need to know the IP-Adress of your device

## Binding Configuration

Binding needs your Tapo eMail and password to connect to the Tapo-Cloud.
This is only used to create the handshake (cookie) to act with your devices.

To enter your cloud details go to the bindings page, click the TapoControl binding and than configure.
