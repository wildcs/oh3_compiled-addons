## Prerequisites

Before using Smart Plugs with openHAB the devices must be connected to the Wi-Fi network.
This can be done using the Tapo provided mobile app.

## Binding Configuration

Binding needs your Tapo eMail and password to connect to the Tapo-Cloud.
This is used to create the handshake (cookie) to act with your devices and device discovering.
To enter your cloud details add a "TapoControl Cloud-Login"-Thing
In the configuration page of the bridge-thing, enter your eMail and password.

## Discovery

Discovery is done by connecting to the Tapo-Cloud Service. 
All devices stored in your cloud account will be detected even if they are not in your network.
You need to know the IP-Adress of your device. This must be set manually in the thing configuration

## Bridge Configuration

The bridge needs to be configured with by `username` and `password` (Tapo-Cloud login) .
